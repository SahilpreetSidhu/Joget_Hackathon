Implement views for monitoring and managing the inventory.
AI-Driven Matching System
Functionality: Integrate AI models (via API) to categorize food items and match them to recipients.
Components:
Design workflows in Joget to handle data processing and matching logic.
Create user interfaces to display matching results.
Predictive Analytics and Demand Forecasting
Functionality: Predict future demand based on historical data.
Components:
Incorporate Jogetâ€™s reporting and dashboard features to visualize demand trends.
Suggest optimized distribution routes.
User-Friendly Donor and Recipient Interfaces
Functionality: Develop intuitive interfaces for both donors and recipients.
Components:
Create user-centric forms for donors to submit contributions.
Design dashboards for recipients to track their allocated food items.
3. Technical Approach
Integration with AI
Use Jogetâ€™s integration capabilities to connect with external AI services or APIs for categorization, matching, and forecasting.
Consider using Jogetâ€™s plugin or API integration tools to incorporate AI functionalities into your app.
Data Management

4. Example Use Case
Donation Entry:
Donors enter details of their contributions via a Joget form (item type, quantity, expiration date).
Matching and Allocation:
The AI system categorizes the items and matches them with recipients based on dietary needs (managed in the Joget application).
Demand Forecasting:
Predictive analytics generate reports and dashboards to help food banks plan for future needs.
Recipient Notification:
Recipients receive notifications about available resources and can view their allocated food items through a Joget-based interface.
5. Presentation and Evaluation
Demonstration:
Showcase how the Joget application integrates with AI services, manages inventory, matches donations, and forecasts demand.
Impact:
Highlight how the application improves efficiency, reduces waste, and better meets the needs of recipients.
Feedback:
Collect feedback from judges and potential users to refine and enhance the application.
Remember, by leveraging Jogetâ€™s low-code platform, you can rapidly prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness of your AI-powered food distribution management system. Creating a compelling PowerPoint presentation to showcase your idea is a great next step! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
