Project Idea: "SmartFoodLink: AI-Enhanced Food Distribution Management"
1. Problem Definition and Objectives:
Objective: Develop a Joget-based application that integrates with AI tools to improve food distribution efficiency by matching donations to recipients’ needs, predicting demand, and optimizing routes.
2. Core Features:
Real-Time Inventory Management:

Functionality: Use Joget’s data management features to create an interface for tracking food donations. Implement real-time updates and notifications for inventory changes.
Components: Build forms for entering food donation details and views for managing and monitoring the inventory.
AI-Driven Matching System:

Functionality: Integrate AI models (e.g., via API) to categorize food items and match them to recipients based on dietary needs and preferences.
Components: Design workflows in Joget to handle data processing and matching logic, and create user interfaces to display matching results.
Predictive Analytics and Demand Forecasting:

Functionality: Use historical data to predict future demand and optimize distribution routes.
Components: Incorporate Joget’s reporting and dashboard features to visualize demand trends and suggested routes.
User-Friendly Donor and Recipient Interfaces:

Functionality: Develop intuitive interfaces for both donors and recipients to view and manage donations, track needs, and receive updates.
Components: Create user-centric forms and dashboards, with Joget’s form builder and UI components, to facilitate interaction with the system.
3. Technical Approach:
Integration with AI:

Use Joget’s integration capabilities to connect with external AI services or APIs for categorization, matching, and forecasting.
Consider using Joget’s plugin or API integration tools to incorporate AI functionalities into your app.
Data Management:

Leverage Joget’s built-in database and data management features to handle real-time inventory and recipient profiles.
Workflow Automation:

Implement Joget’s workflow automation features to manage the flow of data from donation to distribution, ensuring that the right food reaches the right recipients efficiently.
User Interface Design:

Utilize Joget’s form builder and UI components to design an intuitive and accessible interface for all users, including dashboards for monitoring and managing the distribution process.
4. Example Use Case:
Donation Entry: Donors enter details of their contributions via a Joget form, which includes item type, quantity, and expiration date.
Matching and Allocation: The AI system categorizes the items and matches them with recipients based on dietary needs, which are managed in the Joget application.
Demand Forecasting: Predictive analytics generate reports and dashboards that help food banks plan for future needs and adjust distribution strategies.
Recipient Notification: Recipients receive notifications about available resources and can view their allocated food items through a Joget-based interface.
5. Presentation and Evaluation:
Demonstration: Showcase how the Joget application integrates with AI services, manages inventory, matches donations, and forecasts demand.
Impact: Highlight how the application improves efficiency, reduces waste, and better meets the needs of recipients.
Feedback: Collect feedback from judges and potential users to refine and enhance the application.
By leveraging Joget’s low-code platform, you can rapidly prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness of your AI-powered food distribution management system, making it a compelling and practical project for a hackathon.
